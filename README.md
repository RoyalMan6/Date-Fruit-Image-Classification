# Date-Fruit-Image-Classification

There are many date fruit types in Saudi Arabia such as Ajwa, Medjool, Nabtat 
Ali, etc. In this project I've design and implement a deep learning-based image classification system (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) based on a provided image of a date.

I've used an architecture thatâ€™s in the TensorFlow tutorial (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification). The architecture was made for 
image classification in particular. The model consists of several layers, including a 
convolutional layer for feature extraction, max pooling layers for down-sampling, and fully 
connected layers for classification these layers take the output of the previous layer, which is 
a high-level representation of the image, and apply weights to make the final prediction. The 
model activated by a ReLU activation function. ReLU is a commonly used activation function 
in deep learning and has been found to work well in practice. The model is trained using 
supervised learning, where labeled images are used to learn the parameters of the network.
